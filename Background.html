<h3>Country profile:</h3>
<p>Bangladesh is a country located in South Asia. It is bordered by
India in its West, North, and East regions, and Myanmar to its Southeast
regions. The country has a flat geography with over 700 rivers and
tributaries that originate from three main river systems: the
Brahmaputra-Jamuna, Ganges-Padma, and Surma-Meghna (. As of 2020,
Bangladesh was the ninth most densely populated country in the world;
its present day population is 169,469,771. In 2016, 13.47% of the
population in Bangladesh lived below the international poverty line of
$2.15 per day. However, by 2022, the poverty rate had declined to 10.44%
which shows improvement however it is important to recognize that a
little over 10% of the population still lives below the national poverty
line. Agriculture is the country’s primary economic sector, which makes
up 37.6% of the total work force and 13.1% of the GDP.</p>
<p>The country is characterized by a multi-tiered administrative
structure that helps in governing the country effectively. This
structure encompasses several levels, including divisions, districts,
upazilas (sub-districts), unions, and villages. The country has 8
divisions: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi,
Rangpur, and Sylhet, which serve as the highest level of administrative
units. Each division is further divided into 64 districts, comparable to
counties in the USA. Within the divisions, multiple upazilas
(sub-districts) play a crucial role in implementing government policies.
The number of upazilas varies based on population density and
administrative requirements, with a recorded count of 544 upazilas until
2022. These upazilas are divided into unions, which are composed of
several villages and are responsible for local government functions and
community well-being. Villages are the smallest unit of administration
and are primarily located in rural areas. They accommodate the majority
of the population and play a significant role in the socio-economic role
of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>While there is a systematic administrative structure in place, the
country still faces many socio-economic challenges such as a high
population density, the country’s vulnerability to rising sea levels,
flooding, limited access to healthcare, and gender inequality.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-flood-conditions" class="section level3">
<h3>Flood conditions:</h3>
<p>Bangladesh is a topographically flat country lying at the delta
region of three major rivers: the Ganges, Biahmaputra, and Meghna.
Almost 60% of the country is lower than 6m above sea level which
contributes to slow draining and increases the risk of overflow. The
country also experiences a monsoon season that spans from
June-September. The Ganges and Biahmaputra originate from the Himalayan
region which experiences heavy snowfall during the winter. The snow
melts during the warmer months and increases river discharge downstream.
The combination of heavy rainfall, the flat geography, and the increased
river discharge from snowmelt contributes to the severity of floods in
Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Some factors that determine whether an area is more susceptible to
flooding than others include elevation, geography, and infrastructure
(drainage systems, water management systems, etc..) . River basins near
Bangladesh’s three major rivers are more susceptible to flooding due to
their extensive drainage areas, high sediment loads, and proximity to
the Himalayan snow melt that was mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>The coastal regions of Bangladesh, including the South-Western and
South-Central parts, are highly susceptible to flooding. The combination
of cyclones, rising sea levels, and excessive rainfall increases the
risk of tidal storms and flooding on the flat areas. The central and
eastern parts of Bangladesh are also susceptible to flooding, though the
intensity and duration will vary. Flooding in this region is caused by
heavy monsoon rainfall and limited drainage capacity of the Padma
river.</p>
<p>While the north/northeastern parts of Bangladesh are far from large
bodies of water, this region floods the most due to its proximity to the
Himalayas. Snow melt and rainfall causes water to flow rapidly
downstream and onto Bangladesh’s flat land leading to flash floods.</p>

<div id="section-goals-and-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>
<div id="section-research-question" class="section level3">
<h3>Research question:</h3>
<p>The research question we are centering our study on are the effects
of prenatal exposure to flooding on birth outcomes and the mechanisms
through which floods affect birth outcomes. Flooding is found to have a
correlation between worsened birth outcomes including lower birth
weight, cognitive function, and height (Mallett, 2017). Additionally,
the timing of flood exposure on pregnant women will affect the severity
of fetal growth. The second part of our research aims to look at the
mechanisms of which flooding affects societal access to sources of
nutrition and healthcare services. When flooding occurs, the
availability of obtaining clean water becomes increasingly more
difficult as water gets contaminated. Street and road access also
becomes inaccessible. These factors directly affect mothers and their
availability to access adequate nutrition and health care. In this
paper, we will further observe the effects of flood exposure on prenatal
expire on birth outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<p>During our 10-week study, we will conduct literature review on
prenatal exposure to flooding and birth outcomes. To collect flooding
data and birth outcomes in Bangladesh from the year 2018 - 19, we will
be using satellite data on google earth engine and the BIHS survey. With
the satellite data, we will download flood statistics and generate maps
based on our findings. In order to accurately capture the effects of
flooding, the flood statistics will be joined with the survey data
leading to a multivariate analysis of main outcomes and flooding. Our
team will explore the mechanisms through which floods affect birth
outcomes. Based on our research, we will result in a poster and
presentation which will be delivered at the Virginia Tech Symposium and
an interactive Shiny App webpage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-research-design" class="section level2">
<h2>Research Design</h2>
<div id="section-lit-review" class="section level3">
<h3>Lit review:</h3>
<p>Due to the short discourse of our 10-week program, we will be
reviewing other relevant and credible literature relating to research
questions. A number of research papers converge to the point that flood
exposure negatively affects birth outcomes. Most of them highlight food
insecurity and healthcare inaccessibility during flood periods to be the
main cause of poor birth outcomes that include lower birth weight, child
stuntedness which in most cases lead to higher infant mortality,
morbidity, developmental problems and diseases in adulthood (Wilcox,
2001)​. For example, the 2021 paper by Oskorouchi, et al t, suggest that
exposure to flooding during a 12-month period decreased daily calorie
con-sumption by approximately 60 kcal while increasing the probability
of iron, vita-min A, and vitamin C deficiency by 11, 12, and 27
percentage points, respectively. This emphasizes the fact that if a
pregnant mother is exposed to flood, she would be more likely to have
fetal development issues and hence negative birth outcomes. However,
this paper has a problem, for their analysis, they solely relied on
self-reported data to assess flood exposure. Self-reported data are
susceptible not only to the inaccuracies of memory but also to various
cognitive biases such as reference dependence (Guiteras et al.,
2015).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-research-design-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Research design:</h3>
<p>In our research, we will use the Bangladesh Integrated Household
Survey (BIHS) data collected by IFPRI. We will utilize cross-sectional
data for the year 2018-2019, from round 3 of the BIHS survey, which is
the most recent available household survey. The sample design had two
main objectives: capturing the rural areas of Bangladesh (national
representation) and including all seven administrative divisions in
Bangladesh, divisional representation. The BIHS sample also included
observations from the Feed The Future (FTF) zone of influence, which we
are going to discard from our sample to avoid over-sampling issues To
determine the sample size meeting the above-mentioned conditions, the
IFPRI survey team used a careful 2-stage stratified statistical sampling
method to satisfy the above mentioned conditions. In the first stage,
they selected Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), which are villages in this
context, using probability proportional to size based on the number of
households in each stratum or division. The allocation of PSUs resulted
in the following distribution: 21 PSUs in Barisal, 48 in Chittagong, 87
in Dhaka, 27 in Khulna, 29 in Rajshahi, 27 in Rangpur, and 36 in Sylhet,
and 50 in the FTF zone. In the second stage, 20 households were randomly
selected from each PSU. The IFPRI sample size was 6,500 households
across 325 PSUs. Our sample size, however, is a bit smaller than the
6,500 households because we excluded 1000 households from the FTF Zone
of Influence. Also, it is important to note that, since we are using the
data from the 3rd round of the survey, several changes happened within
households between 2011-12 and 2018-19: households from the first round
have either merged, or split. After making all those adjustments our
sample size turns out to be 5604 households. In addition to the survey
data we will use Sentinel-1 data to assess the flood extent.<br />
Sentinel-1 is a satellite by the European Space Agency launched in 2014.
It uses radar to gather data information from the earth’s surface and
generates high-resolution images as radar sensors are not sensitive to
atmospheric conditions. There are a few steps we followed to gather our
flood data. First we chose our study area: this is setting a buffer zone
around each sampled household so that we examine how much it was
affected by the flood. Second, we chose the timeframe based on when the
mother was pregnant so that we can birth outcomes based on the mother’s
flood exposure</p>
</div>
<div id="section-desc-of-survey" class="section level3">
<h3>Desc of survey:</h3>
<p>To gather more information about the health and living conditions of
Bangladesh, we will be using the BIHS, conducted by our stakeholders,
IFPRI, stationed in Bangladesh. The survey is composed of multiple
modules. However, in our study we will focus mainly on modules A, B, W,
and Y. Module A will provide insight on the sample households and
identification; this includes information on coordinates of the
household and the total number of members in the household. Coordinates
of the household will be used to locate the proximity of these
households to the affected flooded areas. Module B covers the Household
Composition and Education. THis module entails the education levels,
occupation, and source of income for individuals of the household.
Module W focuses on the anthropometry, health, and illnesses of each
individual of the household. Module Y has sectional portions containing
survey data on child and antenatal care, Infant and child feeding
practices, immunization and health of children younger than the age of
two and service use.</p>
